By default rust compilation into wasm creates global ‘__stack_pointer’, which initialized by end of stack address. Unfortunately this global is not export. By default ‘__stack_pointer’ has number 0 in globals, so if there is ‘__stack_pointer’ in a name section, then we suppose that 0 global contains stack end addr, and insert an export for this global. This export can be used in runtime to identify end of stack memory and skip its uploading to storage."]],"mod":[["optimize",""]],"struct":[["WasmBuilder","WASM building tool."]]};
